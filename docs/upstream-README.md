Cleanuparr is an advanced download manager for the Servarr ecosystem. It works with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, and Whisparr alongside download clients like qBittorrent, Transmission, and Deluge. Beyond cleaning up stalled, blocked, and malicious downloads, it searches for missing content and quality upgrades, manages seeding, and removes orphaned files.

Cleanuparr was created primarily to address malicious files, such as `*.lnk` or `*.zipx`, that were getting stuck in Sonarr/Radarr and required manual intervention. Some of the reddit posts that made Cleanuparr come to life can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqnx16/psa_sonarr_downloaded_a_virus/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqwklr/sonar_downloaded_a_mkv_file_which_looked_like_a/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpw2wa/downloaded_waiting_to_import/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpi344/downloads_not_importing_no_files_found/).
